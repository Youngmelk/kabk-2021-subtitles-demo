00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:02.950
What is an accent?

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.100
The first time you 
hear a voice that sounds

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.860
different than your own, 
you learn about accent.

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.430
Maybe you live in a city 
full of people from every

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.420
corner of the world, or maybe you 
just moved to a neighboring town.

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.050
It's hard to pin down, 
but it's always there.

7
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.360
Accent includes elements of 
pronunciation and articulation,

8
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.290
which have to do with 
our bodies and speech.

9
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.870
When producing speech sounds, 
we have a number of

10
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.440
instruments at our disposal: 
tongues, teeth, nasal cavities, lips.

11
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.990
Beyond pronunciation, accent 
captures rhythm, pitch, intonation,

12
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.830
the length of speech segments, 
tempo and volume.

13
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.410
Accent is also not the 
same as dialect, which refers to

14
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.810
a fully functioning 
language variety.

15
00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.880
A pattern of speech

16
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.540
can be both a dialect and 
an accent within a distinct

17
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.920
regional or social group.

18
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.250
However, an accent does not include

19
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.780
grammar or vocabulary.

20
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.660
It refers only to speech sounds,

21
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.550
which can become a powerful gatekeeper 
in a society laced with bias.

22
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.530
Migration has increased sharply 
over the last 25 years,

23
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.920
and it is not likely 
to slow down anytime soon.

24
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.540
With a surge in cultural 
and ethnic diversity,

25
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.850
one might expect a new 
norm of acceptance.

26
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.180
But instead of an increase in empathy towards 
difference, nationalism and anti-immigrant

27
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.680
attitudes are rampant.

28
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.850
We have to consider how 
speech and language play

29
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.370
a pivotal role in our 
reconfiguring world.

30
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.830
If a person does not assimilate

31
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.210
perfectly to their new country, they are 
seen as a threat to the nation state.

32
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.590
And although there is no 
such thing as unaccented speech,

33
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.810
having a non-native accent can 
pose problems in all aspects of life.

34
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.240
Just how much can sound affect our 
ability to be perceived by others?

35
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.580
After all, aren't people more judgmental
on the basis of physical appearance?

36
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.930
Our listening skills are more 
nuanced than you might expect.

37
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.330
A study conducted in 1984 
prompted Americans to listen to

38
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.280
progressively shorter clips of English
speech from two unmarked categories:

39
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.910
native English speakers 
and native French speakers.

40
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.620
The study revealed

41
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.510
that a listener can detect a non-native
accent in less than 30 seconds,

42
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.050
regardless of familiarity 
with the accent in question.

43
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.010
From my home country of 
North America to the Netherlands,

44
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.270
we will explore the reality 
that what we say often matters

45
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.450
much less than how we say it.

46
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.050
What happens when the speech 
we hear is not what we expect?

47
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.890
A voice is much more than just sound.

48
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.800
The United States has the highest 
number of immigrants of any country,

49
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.850
and it is estimated that more 
than half of the world's population

50
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.340
uses two or more languages daily.

51
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.280
This is especially true of people

52
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.480
living in Europe, where there is a 
deep familiarity of multilingualism

53
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.590
in everyday life.

54
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.160
That doesn't mean that 
all languages are equal.

55
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.140
Accent, then, becomes an immediate 
signifier of whether or not

56
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.550
a person can be judged as 
familiar or foreign, leading to snap

57
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.470
judgments on their ethnic origin, 
socio-economic class and background.

58
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.170
Unlike other characteristics such 
as gender, national origin or race,

59
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.370
accent is not specifically 
protected against discrimination

60
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.960
under any current policy.

61
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.050
This provides a loophole 
for the gatekeepers

62
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.310
of society to legally reject 
a person based on their voice.

63
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.800
Think of landlords, employers, 
government workers and judges.

64
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.640
Your accent could prevent you 
from finding a place to live

65
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.350
or earning a steady income.

66
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.690
It could even be the tipping point

67
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.190
in a request for asylum.

68
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.730
Although accent-based 
discrimination cannot

69
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.280
be untangled from ideas of race, ethnicity
or origin, we need to rethink

70
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.130
the way that we listen to people 
who don't sound like us.

71
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.740
Labeling someone as having a "heavy" accent
can be used as a thinly veiled

72
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.230
disguise for xenophobia 
in policymaking.

73
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.990
Without a working knowledge of

74
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.250
the key difference between accent 
and intelligibility, this form

75
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.320
of discrimination goes unquestioned.

76
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.880
Here in The Hague,

77
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.160
the International City of Peace and
Justice, denying someone a full life

78
00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.110
based on their voice, the foundation
of their identity, cannot be permitted.

79
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.370
And humans are not the only imperfect
listeners we have to worry about.

80
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.130
The world is becoming increasingly populated
by digital voices and digital ears.

81
00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.290
We have to actively challenge the
imagined neutrality of the machine listener.

82
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.690
After all, social hierarchies are 
not erased when algorithms are made,

83
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.900
but our human bias is iterated faster
and on more levels than ever before.
